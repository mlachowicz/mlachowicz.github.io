# About

My name is Marcin and I live in the South of Poland.

I'm just yet another IT professional who loves to explore new concepts and technologies. I donâ€™t know all the answers, but I'm agile and quite proficient in working out how to find out the solutions.

This space is my personal sketchbook for taking notes -- on various topics related to tech, cybersecurity, or OSINT. 

For anyone who can find this useful...
