Worn car keys can be a problem even for people who care a lot about their car. If you have such a broken key, don't worry - replacing the cover can be an easy and inexpensive task. While professional replacement or fixing of broken key covers can vary in cost depending on the region and car brand, you can save some money by doing it yourself at home. Even if you're using a modern electronic key with a transponder system that connects to an immobilizer, you can still replace the cover on your own and I will show you how to do that ðŸ˜€

## Immobilizer and transponder

An immobilizer is an electronic security device that prevents a car's engine from starting unless the correct key (transponder or smart key) is present. This prevents car theft by making it difficult to "hot wire" the vehicle. Studies have shown that the uniform application of immobilizers has reduced the rate of car theft by 40%.

Transponder keys, also known as "chip keys," are automotive ignition keys that have a signal-emitting circuit built inside. When the key is turned in the ignition, the car's computer sends a radio signal to the transponder circuit. The circuit responds by sending a coded signal back to the computer. If the code is incorrect or the circuit doesn't respond, the engine won't start, which helps prevent car theft. Transponder keys are difficult to duplicate and offer protection by making it nearly impossible for intruders to start the car.

However, transponder keys can be easily damaged if they are exposed to electrical impulses, humidity, or direct sunlight. It's important to store them in a safe place, away from objects that might cause mechanical damage. If a transponder key is damaged or broken, the owner can get a new one from their car dealership or an automotive locksmith.

Some people may not even realize they have a transponder key, as the circuit is hidden inside the plastic head of the key. However, other types of keys, such as General Motors' VATS keys, use a visible resistor to prevent the engine from starting if the electrical resistance is incorrect or the key doesn't have a resistor.

## Preparation

Besides Kioptrix's image file, obviously, you need software to run it. Paid <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html" target="_blank">VMware Fusion</a> or free <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_blank">Virtual Box</a> will be the best way to go. I don't want to focus here on how to run the VM itself, as this is really very intuitive and there are plenty of tutorials on how to do that.

If you're setting up your offensive system and Kioptrix on the same machine, the best solution is to set both Network Adapters as Bridged. Bridged networking connects your virtual machine to a network using the network adapter on your host system. If your host system is on a network, this is the easiest way to give your virtual machine access to that network.

Bridged networking also sets up your virtual machine as a unique identity on the network, separate from and unrelated to your host system. Your virtual machine becomes a full participant in the network, with access to other machines on the network, and other machines on the network can contact it as if it were a physical computer on the network.

After setting everything up, you have to just run the Kioptrix machine. You don't have to log in (and you cannot, as you don't have a password yet), just leave it on in the background and use your default preferred Linux distribution to start the game.

## Tools

You will need also a Linux distribution - the best choice will be <a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-platforms" target="_blank">Kali Linux</a> or <a href="https://parrotsec.org/download/" target="_blank">Parrot OS</a>, as both of those distros are penetration testing focused and have all tools that you need.
