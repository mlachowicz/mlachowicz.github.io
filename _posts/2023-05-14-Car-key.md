Worn car keys can be a problem even for people who care a lot about their car. If you have such a broken key, don't worry - replacing the case can be an easy and inexpensive task. While professional replacement or fixing of broken key cases can vary in cost depending on the region and car brand, you can save some money by doing it yourself at home. Even if you're using a modern electronic key with a transponder system that connects to an immobilizer, you can still do the fix on your own and I will show you how to do that ðŸ˜€

## Tools

To complete this repair, I'm using a [Leatherman Charge](https://www.leatherman.com/charge-552.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, but for most of the steps, you can use virtually any simple tools you can find at home. If you want to prepare beforehand, you can follow the list below.

* Eyeglass flat and Phillips screwdrivers
* Small and medium flat scredrivers
* Small pliers or tweezers
* Soldering iron

Of course, you'll also need a new case for your key. You can check your local car shop, but they're also easily available on online shops like [AliExpress](https://aliexpress.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Just type the brand and model of your car + "key replacement" or "key case". Since key cases come in different shapes and sizes, make sure you're searching for one that's designed for your specific car key and will fit the electronic board.

In this tutorial, I will replace the case for Kia Ceed, but for most regular cars the steps will be pretty same.

## Repair

First, we need to open the case. Some of them are quite tight-fitted so a small flat screwdriver can be handy. Let's start with the battery cover which is at the back.

You can remove the battery by sliding it slightly.

To open a case fully we will need to use even more force and a little bit larger screwdriver to pry two halves of plastic cover.

Immobilizer and transponder

An immobilizer is an electronic security device that prevents a car's engine from starting unless the correct key (transponder or smart key) is present. This prevents car theft by making it difficult to "hot wire" the vehicle. Studies have shown that the uniform application of immobilizers has reduced the rate of car theft by 40%.

Transponder keys, also known as "chip keys," are automotive ignition keys that have a signal-emitting circuit built inside. When the key is turned in the ignition, the car's computer sends a radio signal to the transponder circuit. The circuit responds by sending a coded signal back to the computer. If the code is incorrect or the circuit doesn't respond, the engine won't start, which helps prevent car theft. Transponder keys are difficult to duplicate and offer protection by making it nearly impossible for intruders to start the car.

However, transponder keys can be easily damaged if they are exposed to electrical impulses, humidity, or direct sunlight. It's important to store them in a safe place, away from objects that might cause mechanical damage. If a transponder key is damaged or broken, the owner can get a new one from their car dealership or an automotive locksmith.

Some people may not even realize they have a transponder key, as the circuit is hidden inside the plastic head of the key. However, other types of keys, such as General Motors' VATS keys, use a visible resistor to prevent the engine from starting if the electrical resistance is incorrect or the key doesn't have a resistor.
