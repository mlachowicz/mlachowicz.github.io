Kioptrix is a group of virtual machines that have been made vulnerable on purpose for people to practice and learn penetration testing techniques. Penetration testing is a way to identify and exploit weaknesses in different operating systems and web applications to enhance cybersecurity skills.

The Kioptrix virtual machines simulate real-life situations and are designed to have weaknesses that can be exploited in different ways such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting. By practicing on Kioptrix, you can get hands-on experience in detecting and exploiting these vulnerabilities and learn how to protect systems and applications against potential attacks.

It's important to note that Kioptrix is a legal and ethical way of practicing penetration testing because it's solely meant for educational purposes and shouldn't be used for malicious activities.

First of the Kioptrix series can be found at <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/" target="_blank">VulnHub</a>.

## Preparation

Besides Kioptrix's image file, obviously, you need software to run it. Paid <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html" target="_blank">VMware Fusion</a> or free <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_blank">Virtual Box</a> will be the best way to go. I don't want to focus here on how to run the VM itself, as this is really very intuitive and there are plenty of tutorials on how to do that. You will need also a Linux distribution - the best choice will be <a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-platforms" target="_blank">Kali Linux</a> or <a href="https://parrotsec.org/download/" target="_blank">Parrot OS</a>, as both of those distros are penetration testing focused and have all tools that you need.

If you're setting up your offensive system and Kioptrix on the same machine, the best solution is to set both Network Adapters as Bridged. Bridged networking connects your virtual machine to a network using the network adapter on your host system. If your host system is on a network, this is the easiest way to give your virtual machine access to that network.

Bridged networking also sets up your virtual machine as a unique identity on the network, separate from and unrelated to your host system. Your virtual machine becomes a full participant in the network, with access to other machines on the network, and other machines on the network can contact it as if it were a physical computer on the network.

After setting everything up, you have to just run the Kioptrix machine. You don't have to log in, just leave it on in the background and use your default preferred Linux distribution to start the game.

## Reconnaissance

So first we have to determine the IP address of our Kioptrix victim machine. To do that, we will open terminal and use:

```
sudo arp-scan -l
```

Sudo command allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users the ability to run commands as root. ARP-scan is a tool that uses the ARP protocol to discover and fingerprint IP hosts on the local network. -l	attribute can generate list from interface address and netmask.

```
─# sudo arp-scan -l                                                                                                                                       
Interface: eth0, type: EN10MB, MAC: 00:0c:29:13:ef:aa, IPv4: 192.168.0.10
Starting arp-scan 1.10.0 with 256 hosts (https://github.com/royhills/arp-scan)

5 packets received by filter, 0 packets dropped by kernel
Ending arp-scan 1.10.0: 256 hosts scanned in 2.055 seconds (124.57 hosts/sec). 5 responded
```

In my case, I can see that the IP for vulnerable host run through VMware is 192.168.0.14. At this point, I can check and visit this IP address via browser to confirm there is an HTTP service running on port 80.

## Scanning

I'm using Nmap (“Network Mapper”) to scan the host and determine which ports are open and what network services are running on the machine. 

```
sudo nmap -sSV -O 192.168.0.14
```
There are a couple of interesting things here. -sS is a TCP SYN stealth scan that can be performed quickly, scanning thousands of ports per second on a fast network not hampered by intrusive firewalls. SYN scan is relatively unobtrusive and stealthy since it never completes TCP connections. With -sV and -O attributes we can try to detect the service version and host operating system. If this would be a real server with Intrusion Detection System, I would probably resign with -sV and set -T2 to be less suspicious for the host's IDS.  

```
└─$ sudo nmap -sSV -O 192.168.0.14
